# MVC_BLOG
In this project, I built a simple website blog with architectural patterns.
as well I have built a function to differentiate between users for example we will have 4 types of users
1- Users who visit the website can only read posts and navigate between pages.
2 user who has an account and he can create a post and make comment on posts,
3- admin user has the ability to delete users' posts end edit them.
4- super-admin-user- who can add new users and new admin and can delete them and remove the post as well.

in order to run the application you have to create a migration and as well you will have to create an account with 
cloudinary and set up your own apiKey & ApiSecret and CloudName to upload the images to the cloud.
